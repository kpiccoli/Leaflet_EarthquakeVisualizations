## LEAFLET EARTHQUAKE VISUALIZATIONS

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

### Purpose:
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.
The purpose of this project is to build a new set of tools, using HTML and Javascript to allow the visualizations of earthquake data.


### Dataset:
http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

### Description:
1. Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from dataset based on their longitude and latitude, and magnitude in size and color.
2. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

3. Illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.
